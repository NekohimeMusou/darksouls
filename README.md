# Dark Souls TRPG (Unofficial)

Unofficial system for the Dark Souls TRPG by Hironori Katou and published by Group SNE. NOTE: This is the Japanese game, *not* the D&D-based one by Steamworks. Huge should out to matara for the English translation!

Much CSS and code borrowed from <https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/boilerplate>

## To-do List

Fix armor sheet
Temporarily commented out defense calculations so the half-assed version will still work
