# Dark Souls TRPG (Unofficial)

Unofficial system for the Dark Souls TRPG by Hironori Katou and published by Group SNE. NOTE: This is the Japanese game, *not* the D&D-based one by Steamworks. Massive thanks to [matara](https://mataramakesgames.carrd.co/) for the English translation!

Much CSS and code borrowed from <https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/boilerplate>

## To-do List

- Display equipment weight and evasion cost
- Add weapon functionality
- Clean up UI
- Automate stat increases etc?
